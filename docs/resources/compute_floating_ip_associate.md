} 

resource "t1_vpc_public_ip" "foo" {
  region = "ru-central1"
}

## Schema

### Required

- `floating_ip` (String) Dedicated floating IP address from created `public_ip` order, which will be associated with VM network interface. Changing this will dissociate current floating IP from instance network interface and associate another.
- `instance_id` (String) ID of the `instance` order , which network interface will be associated with floating IP address. Changing this will dissociate floating IP from current instance network interface and associate to another.
